A collective project of ruined applications. The best part is; everything is completely legal!

## How does it work?
Your favourite apps decide to drain you. Luckily for us, people collect older versions of these applications where such features might not exist unless it was there since the beginning. This is a neat way to avoid paying to these greedy companies while still being completely legal. It is not illegal to use an older version of some application, because you haven't applied any modification on it.

Our files are fireproof and we've ran them through multiple different virus tests. Though, still you're downloading our content at your own risk. These files are official, but they've gone through the funnel of people that might want something from you. That is not our responsibility.
